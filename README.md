## Architecture

This monorepo contains multiple micro-frontends orchestrated by a shell application:

- **Shell App** (Port 3000) - React 18 shell with navigation and orchestration
- **Invoice App** (Port 3001) - **UPDATED**: AngularJS 1.x invoice management with React wrapper
- **Payment App** (Port 3002) - React + TypeScript payment processing  
- **App3** (Port 3003) - React + TypeScript analytics and planning

### Integration Methods

| App | Integration Method | Status |
|-----|-------------------|--------|
| Shell | Host Application | ‚úÖ Active |
| Invoice App | **Module Federation** | ‚úÖ **Recently Migrated** |
| Payment App | Module Federation | ‚úÖ Active |
| App3 | Module Federation | ‚úÖ Active |

**Note**: The Invoice App was successfully migrated from iframe to Module Federation for better performance and integration.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üè† **Unified Shell Application**
- **Seamless Navigation**: Tab-based routing between micro-frontends
- **Theme Management**: Dark/Light mode with real-time synchronization across all MFEs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with optimized layouts
- **Modern UI**: Gradient backgrounds, smooth transitions, and polished animations

### üìÑ **Invoice Management MFE**
- **Advanced React Table**: Material React Table integrated in AngularJS app via Module Federation
- **Real-time Filtering**: Search by invoice number, client name, or filter by status
- **Invoice Statistics**: Live dashboard showing total, paid, unpaid, overdue counts and amounts
- **Action Buttons**: View invoice details and mark invoices as paid
- **Responsive Mobile**: Optimized table view for all screen sizes

### üí≥ **Payment Processing MFE**
- **Invoice Selector**: Dynamic dropdown with auto-refresh after payment
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation for card details and expiry date
- **Invoice Details**: Shows selected invoice information (client, amount, due date)
- **Mock Payments**: Simulates payment processing with success/error handling
- **Cross-MFE Events**: Emits payment events to update invoice status across apps

### üéØ **Cross-Cutting Features**
- **Module Federation**: Zero-reload micro-frontend integration
- **Shared State**: Theme and payment events synchronized across all apps
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful fallback when remote MFEs are unavailable
- **Independent Deployment**: Each MFE can be deployed and updated separately
- **Framework Agnostic**: React 18 and AngularJS 1.x working together seamlessly

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, AngularJS 1.x, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS Variables (shared across all apps)
- **Build**: Webpack 5 with Module Federation
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspace support
- **Development**: Hot Module Replacement, Live Reloading
- **State Management**: Event-driven communication via Custom Events

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Start all micro-frontends
pnpm start
```

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Start all apps in development mode
pnpm start

# 2. Access the applications
# Shell App: http://localhost:3000
# Invoice App: http://localhost:3001 (Module Federation)
# Payment App: http://localhost:3002
# App3: http://localhost:3003
```

**Note**: The Invoice App now runs as a Module Federation remote, not as a standalone iframe application.

### Individual App Development

```bash
# Shell App (Port 3000)
cd apps/shell_app && pnpm start

# Invoice App (Port 3001) 
cd apps/invoice_app && pnpm start

# Payment App (Port 3002)
cd apps/payment_app && pnpm start

# App3 (Port 3003)
cd apps/app3 && pnpm start
```

## Tailwind CSS

All applications use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling:

- **Shared Configuration**: `tailwind.config.js` at root level
- **Shared Styles**: `libs/ui-styles/src/shared-styles.css`
- **PostCSS**: Configured for all webpack builds
- **Design System**: Custom colors and typography defined

## Module Federation

Each micro-frontend exposes components via Webpack Module Federation:

- `shell` - Orchestrates and consumes all remotes
- `invoice_app/App` - **NEW**: React wrapper for AngularJS invoice management
- `payment_app/PaymentForm` - React payment component  
- `app3/App` - React analytics component

### Recent Transformation: Iframe ‚Üí Module Federation

The Invoice AngularJS app has been successfully transformed from iframe-based integration to Module Federation:

- **Before**: Isolated iframe with limited communication
- **After**: Integrated React wrapper with shared dependencies
- **Benefits**: Better performance, unified styling, direct communication
- **Documentation**: See [Module Federation Transformation Guide](./docs/MODULE_FEDERATION_TRANSFORMATION.md)

## Development Workflow

1. **Shell First**: Always start the shell app first (port 3000)
2. **Remote Apps**: Start individual micro-frontends as needed
3. **Shared Dependencies**: React, React-DOM shared across all apps
4. **Hot Reloading**: All apps support HMR for fast development
