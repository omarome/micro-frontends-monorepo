# Fix: Popup Auto-Opens When Clicking "Mark Paid"

## Issue

When clicking the "Mark as Paid" button on an invoice in the React Material Table, the invoice details popup would automatically open after marking the invoice as paid. This was unintended behavior.

## Root Cause

In both `invoice.controller.js` and `app.js`, after successfully marking an invoice as paid, the code was automatically setting `vm.selectedInvoice` (or `$scope.selectedInvoice`) to the updated invoice:

```javascript
// invoice.controller.js - Line 63
vm.selectedInvoice = updatedInvoice;

// app.js - Line 44
$scope.selectedInvoice = invoice;
```

In the AngularJS template, when `vm.selectedInvoice` (or `$scope.selectedInvoice`) is set to a non-null value, it triggers the invoice details popup to display:

```html
<!-- invoice-template.html -->
<div ng-if="vm.selectedInvoice" class="invoice-popup-overlay" ng-click="vm.closeInvoiceDetails()">
  <!-- Popup content -->
</div>
```

## Solution

Removed the automatic assignment of `selectedInvoice` after marking an invoice as paid. The popup should only open when the user explicitly clicks the "View" button or clicks on a table row.

### Files Modified

#### 1. `apps/legacy_app/src/components/invoice/invoice.controller.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
vm.selectedInvoice = updatedInvoice;
vm.stats = InvoiceModel.getInvoiceStats(vm.invoices);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Don't automatically open the details popup after marking as paid
// vm.selectedInvoice = updatedInvoice; // REMOVED
vm.stats = InvoiceModel.getInvoiceStats(vm.invoices);
```

#### 2. `apps/legacy_app/src/app.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
invoice.status = 'paid';
invoice.paidDate = response.invoice.paidDate;
$scope.selectedInvoice = invoice;
```

**After:**
```javascript
invoice.status = 'paid';
invoice.paidDate = response.invoice.paidDate;
// Don't automatically open the details popup after marking as paid
// $scope.selectedInvoice = invoice; // REMOVED
```

## User Experience After Fix

### Before
1. User clicks "Mark as Paid" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms
4. Invoice status updates in the table ✓
5. **Invoice details popup automatically opens** ✗ (unwanted)

### After
1. User clicks "Mark as Paid" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms
4. Invoice status updates in the table ✓
5. Success alert shows
6. **Popup does NOT open automatically** ✓ (desired behavior)
7. User can click "View" button or row to manually open popup if needed

## Testing

**Restart the legacy_app server:**
```bash
cd apps/legacy_app
npm start
```

**Test the fix:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Find an unpaid invoice
3. Click "Mark as Paid" button
4. Confirm the action
5. **Expected Results:**
   - Invoice status updates to "Paid" in the table
   - "Mark as Paid" button disappears from that row
   - Success alert shows
   - **Popup does NOT automatically open**
   - Stats at the top update correctly

## Reasoning

The original behavior of auto-opening the popup after marking as paid might have been intended to show the user that the update was successful and display the `paidDate`. However:

1. **The success alert already confirms the action**
2. **The table updates visually (status badge changes to "Paid")**
3. **Auto-opening interrupts the user's workflow** - they might want to mark multiple invoices as paid quickly
4. **Users can manually open the popup if they want to see details**

## Related Behavior

The popup should only open in these scenarios:
- User clicks the "View" button on a row
- User clicks anywhere on a row (except buttons)
- User needs to see invoice details

The popup should NOT open automatically for system actions like:
- Marking invoice as paid
- Loading data
- Filtering or sorting

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ Marking multiple invoices as paid in sequence - no popup interruptions
✅ User can still open popup manually after marking as paid
✅ Success alert still shows to confirm the action
✅ Stats update correctly without opening popup
✅ EventBus still emits events for other MFEs

## Performance Impact

None - this change actually improves performance slightly by avoiding unnecessary DOM updates for the popup when it's not needed.

## Conclusion

Removing the automatic `selectedInvoice` assignment improves UX by not interrupting the user's workflow while still providing clear feedback that the invoice was marked as paid.
